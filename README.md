RECRUITMENT PORTAL (SIGNIN AND LOGINFORM)
Tools used:
•	Front end: React(JavaScript),CSS.
•	Back End:Node.js, Postman Database.
   This is the app where the user is going to signin if he/she are new to the website.
   When user is signing  for the first time the user has to signin to the portal. After signing it shows that account has been created succesfully.Then the user can directly login to the 
   portal.
     In this code i have used react,node,javasccript which has given me correct output.
